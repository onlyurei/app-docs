IntoFan Soft is not responsible for any damages or losses that can be related to the use of this app.**\r\n\r\nColors of the specs table cells indicate the compatibility of the new tire/wheel in that spec:\r\n- No color: compatible\r\n<span style=\"background-color:#00ff00\">- Green: improved</span>\r\n<span style=\"background-color:#ffff00\">- Yellow: tolerable</span>\r\n<span style=\"background-color:#ff0000\">- Red: not compatible</span>\r\n\r\n**Why is it important to keep the replacement tire's overall circumference as close as possible to the original tire's?**\r\n\r\nMost of the vehicles rely on the tire's revs per mile/kilometer to calculate the vehicle speed, which is the input of various important parts of the vehicle such as speedometer, odometer, ABS, etc.\r\n\r\nIf the replacement tire's overall circumference has large discrepancy than the original tire's, the tire's revs per mile/kilometer will change by a large amount accordingly, so as the derived vehicle speed. It then affects the accuracy and effectiveness of the aforementioned important parts of the vehicle to the degree beyond the safe point.\r\n\r\nSince the tires' overall circumference vary, it doesn't make sense to set an absolute threshold value of the discrepancy in length, instead, percentage is used.\r\n\r\nThe app's default and recommended value of the maximum tire circumference difference percentage is 1.5.\r\n\r\n**Vehicle unsprung weight explained**\r\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsprung_weight](/web/20131216145735/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsprung_weight)",
